                <p class="para"></p>
                <p class="para2">A round diamond is a popular and classic shape for a diamond used in jewelry, particularly in engagement rings.</p>
                <p class="para3">It is characterized by its circular outline and is known for its brilliant sparkle and fire. 
                    The round brilliant cut is the most common style for round diamonds, 
                    featuring 57 or 58 facets that maximize the diamond's ability to reflect 
                    light and create a dazzling appearance.</p>

                <h2>PRINCESS</h2>
                <p class="para4">The princess cut is a popular diamond shape used in jewelry, especially in engagement rings. It is a square or rectangular shape with pointed corners and is known for its modern and elegant appearance. </p>
                <p class="para5">Key features of a princess cut diamond include:

                    Square or Rectangular Shape: Princess cut diamonds are typically square, but some variations may have a slightly rectangular shape. The corners are usually pointed.
                    
                    Brilliant Cut: Like the round brilliant cut, the princess cut is a type of brilliant cut with numerous facets to enhance the diamond's brilliance.
                    
                    Facets: Princess cut diamonds usually have either 57 or 76 facets, depending on whether the pavilion (bottom) has pointed or truncated corners.
                    
                    Versatility: The princess cut is versatile and suits various styles, making it a popular choice for engagement rings.</p>

            <p class="para"></p>
            <p class="para2">The pear-shaped diamond, also known as a teardrop or pear-cut diamond, is a distinctive and elegant diamond shape that combines the characteristics of both the round brilliant and marquise cuts.</p>
            <p class="para3">Shape: The diamond has a rounded bottom or "bulb" and a pointed top, creating a unique teardrop shape.

                Brilliant Cut: Similar to round and princess cuts, the pear shape is a brilliant cut, featuring multiple facets to enhance its sparkle.</p>

                <h2>OVAL</h2>
                <p class="para4">Oval diamonds can vary in proportions, with some being more elongated and others more rounded. They often have similar facets and sparkle as round brilliant-cut diamonds, but their elongated shape can make them appear larger than round diamonds of the same carat weight. </p>
                <p class="para5">When choosing an oval diamond, it's essential to consider factors such as the length-to-width ratio, color, clarity, and cut quality to ensure you get the best-looking stone within your budget. Additionally, it's advisable to examine the diamond's symmetry and make sure it doesn't have any visible bowtie effectâ€”a dark area in the center caused by light leakage.</p>

            <p class="para"></p>
            <p class="para2">An "Emerald Cut Diamond" refers to a particular shape of diamond that is rectangular with truncated corners. This cut is known for its step-like facets and elongated appearance. The name "emerald cut" originates from its common use in cutting emeralds, although it's also frequently used for diamonds.</p>
            <p class="para3">Emerald cut diamonds are prized for their elegant and sophisticated look, characterized by a large open table (the flat top surface), long lines, and clean symmetrical appearance. This cut tends to emphasize clarity and color, making imperfections and tint more noticeable compared to other cuts like the round brilliant. As a result, it's essential to choose high-quality stones with excellent clarity and color grades when selecting an emerald cut diamond.</p>
